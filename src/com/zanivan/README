JMEDS: Test Example

Contained files:
	+ StartExample.java
		This file contains the main class of the example. The Device and
		Services are managed and set up here.
	+ TestClient.java
		This file contains the client's code. It calls the operations and
		subscribes for events.
	+ TestService.java
		This file contains the SimpleService's source-code. Here the operations
		are set up and added to the service.
		OneWay and TwoWay Operation are defined here as well.
	+ EventingService.java
		This file contains the EventingService's source-code. Here the
		operations are set up and added to the service.
		The simple Notification- and Attachment-Event are set up here.
	+ PictureFrame.java
		Contains the code to display the picture from the AttachmentEvent. Not
		JMEDS specific, just lame AWT-code!
	+ example.properties
		Contains information about the device, services, bindings and event
		sinks. Every property has an ID. When used as parameter for e.g. the
		LocalService/DefaultDevice constructors this information will be used
		and it is not required to use the respective setter methods.

CAUTION: Linux users may have to add 127.0.0.1 to the multicast-group to receive
multicast messages!


How to start up the example:
	There are two ways to start up the example:
	1. For local testing (standard configuration):
		Just run the main method in the StartExample class.
	2. For remote testing in different JVMs:
		Remove the "new TestClient();" line from the main method in the
		StartExample class.
		Next remove the double-slashes in front of the main method in the
		TestClient class.
		Now run the main method in the StartExample class first. After this run
		the one in the TestClient class.
	
	WARNING: If you want to discover the example device from another location in
			 your network you have to change the IP defined in the
			 example.properties file from 127.0.0.1 to your actual local
			 address.
